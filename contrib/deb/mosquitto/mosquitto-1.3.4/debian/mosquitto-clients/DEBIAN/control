Description: Mosquitto command line MQTT clients
 This is two MQTT version 3.1 command line clients. mosquitto_pub can be used
 to publish messages to a broker and mosquitto_sub can be used to subscribe to
 a topic to receive messages.
 .
 MQTT provides a method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe
 model. It is lightweight, both in terms of bandwidth usage and ease of
 implementation. This makes it particularly useful at the edge of the network
 where a sensor or other simple device may be implemented using an arduino for
 example.
